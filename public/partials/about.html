	<h2>Inspiration</h2>
	<p> I wanted to learn more about Angularjs. I also wanted to increase my productivity and track my progress on some of my self improvement goals. like going to the gym. I usually use google calendar to schedule my days and boost my productivity but I never usually do everything on the calendar. So the week goes by and I really haven't been nearly as productive as my google calendar would infer see pic below. This web app serves to track how productive I really am and to motivate me to be more productive.</p>
	
	<h2> Upcoming features </h2>
	<p> Be able to share progress graphs with friends and family so they can see my progress and help to motivate the user. For example, a gym buddy can see when you miss the gym and could tell you off about it </p>
	<p> Utilize the ionic framework to create a hybrid native mobile application </p>
